## Experiment-1: Component Lazy Loading Using React.lazy and Suspense

---

## Aim
To optimize frontend performance by implementing lazy loading of components in a Single Page Application using `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`.

---

## Software Requirements
- Node.js
- React
- React Router DOM
- Code Editor (VS Code)
- Web Browser

---

## Theory
Lazy loading is a performance optimization technique where components are loaded only when they are required.  
In React, `React.lazy()` allows components to be loaded dynamically, and `Suspense` provides a fallback UI while the component is loading.  
This reduces the initial bundle size and improves page load time.

---

## Procedure
1. Create a React application.
2. Create multiple components.
3. Import components using `React.lazy()`.
4. Wrap lazy-loaded components inside `Suspense`.
5. Observe loading behavior during navigation.
