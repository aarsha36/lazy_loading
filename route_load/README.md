# Unit-5: Optimize Frontend Performance Using Lazy Loading

## Experiment-2: Route-Based Lazy Loading in Single Page Application

---

## Aim
To implement route-based lazy loading to improve performance in a Single Page Application.

---

## Software Requirements
- Node.js
- React
- React Router DOM
- Code Editor (VS Code)
- Web Browser

---

## Theory
Route-based lazy loading ensures that components associated with specific routes are loaded only when the user navigates to that route.  
This reduces the initial bundle size and speeds up application startup, leading to better performance and user experience.

---

## Procedure
1. Install `react-router-dom`.
2. Create multiple route components.
3. Apply lazy loading to route components using `React.lazy()`.
4. Wrap routes inside `Suspense`.
